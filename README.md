# FR-Refactor
The original paper discusses the challenges of adapting software systems to changing requirements and the role of feature requests and refactoring in addressing these challenges. The paper proposes a learning-based technique that suggests refactoring types based on previous feature requests, implemented refactorings, and code smells. We have reproduced and evaluated the previous work in this area, pointing out potential flaws and proposed a new method, d-BERT.

## How to run:
### Run the code in the exps folder
### Replicated Code
Run the files in the order: Binary and multi class classification.ipynb, CNN_model.ipynb and RQ4_RQ5.ipynb

### d-BERT Model
Please take a look at the README in the ```seq_modelling``` directory.
